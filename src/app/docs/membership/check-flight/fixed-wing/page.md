    title: Fixed Wing Check Flight
    description: A basic check flight conducted in a fixed wing aircraft. This ensures that prospective members have a base understanding of both airfield operations and radio communications. It also allows us to ensure folks are proficient in conversational English, which is a requirement for membership at Global Task Force Overlord.
---

In order to be successful in your check flight, please ensure the following is done prior to starting:

- All [required modifications](/docs/resources/modifications) installed and operational.
- Marianas Terrain installed and operational.
- DCS updated and functional.
- Run a "systems check" of your peripherals (HOTAS, Pedals, Track IR / VR, etc...) to ensure smooth operation.
- A [callsign](/docs/membership/check-flight#callsigns) selected.

{% callout title="Communication is Key" %}
By far, the most common reason for a do-over of your check flight is failure to ensure **clear**, **concise**, and **consistent** radio communications throughout all phases of the check flight.
{% /callout %}

This check flight can be done with any standard DCS module as well as either of the two official modifications we use (A4E-C & Hercules).

It is suggested that you conduct this check flight in the airframe for which you are most comfortable.

## Getting Started & Overview

- Select a **dynamic** slot at **Antonio Won Pat Airport**.
- Your jet should be preprogrammed with the radio frequencies needed to successfully complete the check flight.
- Both airfields you will be visiting during the check flight are **uncontrolled** unless otherwise specified by your instructor.
- We will be flying around Marianas for approximately 200 NM so ensure you have enough fuel for the journey.
- Once complete, we will be returning to **Andersen AFB** including a minimum of two **touch and go** landings and one **full stop**.

{% callout title="Frequency Reminder" %}
The frequencies we will be using during the Check Flight are
**CTAF** 145.00 Mhz AM and
**Strike** 351.500 MHz AM
{% /callout %}

## Taxi & Takeoff

Departure for your check flight will take place on runway **06L** - due to the nature of dyanmic spawns, this almost certaintly means that you will have to cross **06R** and **06L** in order to taxi down to the end of the runway via **KILO** for a **06L** depature. This is the first time of the check flight where **clear** and **concise** radio communications come in play.

{% antoniochart /%}

- When you are ready to taxi the first thing you need to do is call into Antonio Traffic and declare that you are taxing. Utilizing the [Radio Communications](/docs/procedures/radio-communications) procedures, transmit the following radio sequences on **CTAF**:

```radio
--145.00--

ANTONIO TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
TAXING TO RUNWAY "06L" VIA "DELTA" "KILO" FOR DEPARTURE //
```

- You may now begin taxing towards **06L** - knowing that you will likely have to cross **06R**, it is expected that you stop at the hold short line, and once again call out to Antonio Traffic that you are crossing a potentially active runway:

```radio
--145.00--

ANTONIO TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
CROSSING "06R" AT "DELTA" //
```

- Due to the fact that Antonio has two parallel runways, you must once again hold short, this time of **06L** and declare that you are crossing:

```radio
--145.00--

ANTONIO TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
CROSSING "06L" AT "DELTA" //
```

- You may then continue on taxing down towards the button of **06L**, turning onto taxiway **ALPHA** and preparing to enter the runway.
- Double check that the runway, approach and depature are both clear and when safe to do so, declare your intentions:

```radio
--145.00--

ANTONIO TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
TAKING ACTIVE RUNWAY "06L" FOR TAKEOFF //
```

- Once you complete your final safety checks, you are cleared to take off.
- Power up, and take off maintaining runway heading. Altitude is at **your decretion**, keep in mind there is a visual identification element to this check flight and broken cloud coverage starts at approximately 7,000' ASL, so choose your altitude wisely..
- When you reach **8 - 10 NM** away from Antonio, check out of **CTAF** and check into **Strike** with forward controller **FISH**, radio sequence as follows:

```radio
--145.00--

ANTONIO TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
CLEAR OF YOUR AIRSPACE, SWITCHING TACTICAL, GOOD DAY //
```

```radio
--351.50--

FISH //
CHEVY 1-1 //
CHECKING IN OUT OF ANTONIO //
PROCEEDING AS FRAGGED //
```

- Once you have checked in with **FISH**, continue onto the next section of the check flight.

## Navigation & Sight Seeing

### Route

The navigation and sight seeing portion of the check flight is broken down into 4 seperate waypoints, taking you on a journey of approximately 200 NM. Take a look at the map:

{% fwbcfroute /%}

Given that you will have to visually identify what is at each waypoint, it is crucial that you select your altitude accordingly based on what tools you have available. For those who bring along a targeting pod, you may be able to go higher than those who are relying on just their eyeballs. This is entirely up to you which direction you want to go with it.

### Waypoint 1

As you approach **Waypoint 1** you are looking to locate a floatilla of vessels.

Your job, is to identify the **quantity** and **intention** of the boats within the floatilla.

{% callout title="Intention" %}
The intention refers to whether or not the vessels appear to be armed or not.

For example, **military** or **civilian** are viable returns that will provide an indication of their intention.
{% /callout %}

Once you have a accurate count & intention of the floatilla, report into **FISH** who will be awaiting your radio call:

```radio
--351.50--

FISH //
CHEVY 1-1 //
AT WAYPOINT 1 //
EYES ON FLOTILLA //
3 SHIPS, ALL APPEAR CIVILIAN IN NATURE //
```

**FISH** may or may not respond at this point, if they do - follow instructions - if not, declare your intentions to continue on:

```radio
--351.50--

FISH //
CHEVY 1-1 //
CONTINUING ON TO WAYPOINT 2 //
```

### Waypoint 2

**Waypoint 2** will take you over Rota. At this location you are looking for some red & white ground connexes. As with **Waypoint 1**, report into **FISH** with your findings:

```radio
--351.50--

FISH //
CHEVY 1-1 //
AT WAYPOINT 2 //
EYES ON TARGET //
NO THREATS IDENTIFIED //
```

Once again, **FISH** may or may not respond at this point, if they do - follow instructions - if not, declare your intentions to continue on:

```radio
--351.50--

FISH //
CHEVY 1-1 //
CONTINUING ON TO WAYPOINT 3 //
```

### Waypoint 3

As you approach **Waypoint 3** you are looking for a second floatilla of vessels.

Once again, your job is to identify the **quantity** and **intention** of the boats within the floatilla. When ready, report into **FISH**:

```radio
--351.50--

FISH //
CHEVY 1-1 //
AT WAYPOINT 3 //
EYES ON FLOTILLA //
3 SHIPS, 2 CIVILIAN, 1 DESTROYER //
```

And again, **FISH** may or may not respond at this point, if they do - follow instructions - if not, declare your intentions to continue on:

```radio
--351.50--

FISH //
CHEVY 1-1 //
CONTINUING ON TO WAYPOINT 4 //
```

### Waypoint 4

**Waypoint 4** will take you back overland at Guam. At this location you are looking for more red & white connexes. As with all the other waypoints, report into **FISH** with your findings:

```radio
--351.50--

FISH //
CHEVY 1-1 //
AT WAYPOINT 4 //
EYES ON TARGET //
NO THREATS IDENTIFIED //
```

Once you are finished at **Waypoint 4**, you should be lined up well to enter the landing pattern at **Anderson AFB**. Don't forget to report in to **FISH** that you have completed your tasking and will be checking out of **STRIKE**:

```radio
--351.50--

FISH //
CHEVY 1-1 //
TASKING COMPLETE, CHECKING OUT OF STRIKE //
```

In the next sequence we will report into **Anderson AFB** and declare our intentions.

## Landing Pattern

Welcome to Anderson AFB - first and foremost, lets check in with Anderson Traffic:

```RADIO
--145.00--

ANDERSON TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
CURRENTLY "10 NM" TO YOUR "WEST" //
ENTERING LEFT OVERHEAD PATTERN FOR "06L" //
```

For purpooses of the check flight, we will be using runway **06L** as the active runway. As such, in keeping with our [Airfield Operations](/docs/procedures/airfield-operations), you will be conducting a **left hand** overhead pattern.

Take a look at the chart to familiarize yourself on the layout of the airfield:

{% andersonchart /%}

As we mentioned at the end of **Waypoint 4** - if you did everything right, once your done identifying the buildings at **Waypoint 4** you should be on path for an overhead approach of runway **06L** at Anderson.

{% callout type="warning" title="Don't be fooled!" %}
Antonio and Anderson airfields are fairly close together! Once you are done at Waypoint 4 you will be overflying Antonio before getting to Anderson... So don't get lost!
{% /callout %}

### Touch and Goes

To be successful in your check flight, you must demonstrate the ability to conduct **two** (2) safe, touch and go approaches to **06L**. Let's let the traffic pattern know we are commencing our landing procedures:

```radio
--145.00---

ANDERSON TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
UPWIND "06L" //
COMMENCING LANDING, TOUCH AND GO, "06L" //
```

Remembering our [Airfield Operations](/docs/procedures/airfield-operations), the main position where you change altitude in the pattern is the downwind - as such lets declare our intentions:

```radio
--145.00---

ANDERSON TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
DOWNWIND "06L" TOUCH AND GO //
```

And throughout the landing pattern, make your calls:

```radio
--145.00---

ANDERSON TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
TURNING BASE FOR "06L" TOUCH AND GO //
```

```radio
--145.00---

ANDERSON TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
ON FINAL "06L" TOUCH AND GO //
```

```radio
--145.00---

ANDERSON TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
CLEAR "06L", RE-ENTERING LEFT PATTERN FOR "06L" TOUCH AND GO //
```

Repeat that procedure **one** (1) more time, and once you have finished your second touch and go - reenter the pattern and continue onto the full stop landing.

### Full Stop Landing

Not unlike the touch and go landings, you need to perform the full stop landing safely and conducting all necessary radio calls throughout. As with before, lets declare our intentions to Anderson Traffic:

```radio
--145.00---

ANDERSON TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
UPWIND "06L" //
COMMENCING LANDING, FULL STOP, "06L" //
```

Remembering our [Airfield Operations](/docs/procedures/airfield-operations), the main position where you change altitude in the pattern is the downwind - as such lets declare our intentions:

```radio
--145.00---

ANDERSON TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
DOWNWIND "06L" FULL STOP LANDING //
```

And throughout the landing pattern, make your calls:

```radio
--145.00---

ANDERSON TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
TURNING BASE FOR "06L" FULL STOP LANDING //
```

```radio
--145.00---

ANDERSON TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
ON FINAL "06L" FULL STOP LANDING//
```

```radio
--145.00---

ANDERSON TRAFFIC //
CHEVY 1-1 //
CLEAR "06L" AT "HOTEL" TAXING TO PARKING //
```

Once you have safely cleared the runway and taxi'd to the designated parking area, go ahead and shut down your jet. The debrief will likely happen while you are shutting down.

## Conclusion

Once you have completed your check flight, your instructor will provide you some feedback as well as the much anticipated go / no-go decision. So long as they have no reservations, you will be assigned to a squadron based on the airframe you wish to fly the most and can immediately begin participating in more events within the task force.
