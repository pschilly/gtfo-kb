    description: A basic check ride to ensure that prospective members have basic airmanship and communication skills in order to succeed.

## Overview

In general - the check flight, whether it be by way of fixed or rotary wing, is purposefully designed as a barrier of entry to the Task Force. During your check ride we will be ensuring the following:

- Confirms that you have all [required modifications](/docs/resources/modifications) installed and operational.
- Confirms that you are able to effectively communicate in English.
- Confirms that you have a base understanding of [Radio Communications](/docs/procedures/radio-communications).
- Confirms that you have a base understanding of [Airfield Operations](/docs/procedures/airfield-operations).

### What you'll need to succeed

Prior to completing your check flight, there are a few things you must have in place:

- All [required modifications](/docs/resources/modifications) installed and operational.
- Marianas Terrain installed and operational.
- DCS updated and functional.
- Consistent radio communications throughout all phases of the check flight.
- A callsign.

### Callsigns

For the duration of your check flight, there will be 4 different callsigns being used:

- Your callsign, eg:
  - CHEVY 1-1
- ANTONIO TRAFFIC (CTAF)
- ANDERSEN TRAFFIC (CTAF)
- FISH (Strike Comms)

{% callout title="Notice Regarding Your Callsign" %}
It does not matter what callsign you choose - but ensure that it is used consistently throughout all radio communications.
{% /callout %}

## Lets go!

Choose between either a [fixed wing](/docs/membership/check-flight/fixed-wing) or a [rotary wing](/docs/membership/check-flight/rotary-wing) check flight. Once you have an idea as to which path you want to go down, head on over to the **42nd Recieving Squadron** discord channel and request a check flight.
