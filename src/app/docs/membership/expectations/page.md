This Task Force is first, and foremost an entirely **voluntary** venture. We will **never** ask you to forego your real-life commitments in order to attend Task Force Events. This includes training events, campaigns and any other Task Force event.

## Membership Requirements

The follow are required of all members, regardless of the position for which they hold within the Task Force:

- Read and understand the [Task Force Charter](/docs/charter)
- Abide by the [Code of Conduct](/docs/code-of-conduct)
- Read and follow all Standard Operating Policies & Procedures
- Install all & keep up to date all [Required modifications](/docs/resources/modifications).
- Display proper [Task Force Tag](/docs/charter#article-i-name-and-tag) while playing DCS.

The Task Force will never expect that its members will buy any DCS related modules, hardware, etc... **However**, some campaigns may be run on specific terrains that **are** premium in the sense that they are not free. As explained above, there is no requirement for attendance, however, you may not be able to attend if you do not own the terrain and campaigns will not necessarily be created based on whether or not you own a specific terrain.
