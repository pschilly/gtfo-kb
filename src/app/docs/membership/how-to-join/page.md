    description: An overview on how to join the Task Force.

Joining Global Task Force Overlord is a fairly simple process. The first step is to join us in our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/globaltaskforceoverlord).

## Application Process

As stated, the first step is to join our Discord community. Once you have joined - be sure to drop us a line and say Hello in the `#general` channel. If you have any questions about the Task Force, this is the place to ask them! Once you have discovered that this Task Force is the place for you, head on over to the `#enlist-here` channel and submit an application.

The application will bring you to our [membership website](https://globaltaskforceoverlord.org/member) where you will need to login using your Discord credentials. We use this method of authentication to: save you the hassle of remembering yet another password & associate your account record with the discord server so our bots can manage callsigns, ranks, etc...

Fill out the simple application and then wait! Our team generally gets applications processed within a few hours.

## Whats next?

Once your application has been accepted - the next step is to complete your [basic check flight](/docs/membership/check-flight) for either rotary or fixed wing. Once you're done that - you are good to go!
