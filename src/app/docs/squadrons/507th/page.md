***"We Lead with SEAD"***

The Knights is a combination squadron made up of two extremely versatile multi-role airframes. Whether its providing enhanced situational awareness capabilities or effectively suppressing enemy air defenses - the Knights are often the pointy end of the Task Force's spear.

**Primary Airframe:** F-16C Viper

**Primary Mission Skillset:** SEAD/DEAD

## DTC for DCS

DTC for DCS is required tool for F-16s in 507th. We use DTC for DCS as a way to program waypoints,
MFDs, radios, etc. in the jet. A DTC file (.json) is provided for every campaign mission. Load this
into your jet using the software from:

[DTC for DCS Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/the-paid-actor/dcs-dtc/releases)

Also see Schilly's guide on using DTC for DCS:

## Learning Resources

### Chuck's Guides

Chuck's Guide is the most helpful resource for the F-16 in DCS. It is highly referenced in the 507th
training documentation.

[DCS GUIDE - F-16CM VIPER BLOCK 50](https://chucksguides.com/aircraft/dcs/f-16cm/)

### F-16 Landing

The F-16 is difficult to consistently land in DCS, but consistent landings are required to pass the
[GTFO Check Flight](https://kb.globaltaskforceoverlord.org/docs/membership/check-flight). These
resources are helpful for improving landings in the F-16.

["Perfecting your F-16C Landings" by v303rd Fighter Group](https://v303rdfightergroup.com/index.php?pubs/perfecting-your-f-16c-landings.206/)
shows excellent imagery of the HUD and runway picture for optimal landings. This imagery will help a
new pilot get a better mental picture of the landing. The imagery is from Falcon 4.0 or Falcon BMS,
but it all still applies to DCS.

[Tricker's "DCS F16 - Landing Tutorial (The most comprehensive tutorial that exists)"](https://youtu.be/_XDbnECGdhg?si=EqsxQs_L2MuelR6F)
demonstrates an overhead break landing which is the standard landing pattern used in GTFO. This
video also gives an excellent description of the HUD picture on landing.

### Mike Soloyem YouTube

[The Ops Center By Mike Solyom](https://www.youtube.com/@TheOpsCenterByMikeSolyom/featured) has a
wealth of knowledge on fighter procedures and tactics beyond operating your selected airframe.
Tutorials from Mike Solyom are heavily used in 507th training materials.
