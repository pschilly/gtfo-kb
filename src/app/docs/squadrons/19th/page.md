Serving as the Task Force's premiere logistics and ground attack squadron, 19th Air Assault Brigade operates all rotary wing, heavy lift as well as a selection of dedicated ground pounders.

The 19th Helicopter Brigade, known by their battle-hardened nickname "Shake and Bake," has a legacy built on firepower, speed, and unwavering courage. Established in 1967, this elite brigade was formed in response to the growing need for rapid air mobility in modern warfare. Originally equipped with UH-1 Hueys and CH-47 Chinooks, the brigade proved its mettle during the Vietnam War, executing daring insertions, extractions, and resupply missions deep in hostile territory. Over the years, it evolved into a premier fighting force, incorporating the AH-64 Apache gunships to dominate the battlefield. The brigade earned its nickname "Shake and Bake" from its unique combat tactics, in which Chinooks (the "Shake") would transport troops and supplies deep into the battlefield while Apaches (the "Bake") provided devastating fire support, ensuring safe landings and extractions. This synchronized method of rapid deployment and overwhelming force became the signature of the 19th, feared by enemies and revered by allies.
