    description: The Task Force's policy on its members multi-clanning.
---

Global Task Force Overlord's current stance on multi-clan is somewhat different than that of other DCS communities. Currently, the policy is as follows:

## Council Members, Squadron Leadership, Specialists, Flight Instructors

Members who hold any of these positions are expected to **not be a member of another DCS community** while they hold that position. The reason for this is that these positions require significant time commitment to the Task Force and if your time is split between multiple communities the overall Task Force will be affected.

## Regular Membership

Basic members of the Task Force are welcome to be part of other DCS communities as well as GTFO. **However**, it is incumbent on the member to manage their own schedule. **GTFO will not schedule events around other communities**

If you miss a GTFO event (campaign, training, etc...) that is entirely on you - no considerations will be made for other communities.

### Multi-Clanning Member Expectations

If you fall into the category of those who belong to multiple DCS communities - it is encumbent on you, and entirely expected that you will meet **all** of the [Membership Expectations](/docs/membership/expectations) outlined. We recognize that other communities have different rules - but so long as you are a member here, utilziing assets that this Task Force provides you **will** abide by our rules.
