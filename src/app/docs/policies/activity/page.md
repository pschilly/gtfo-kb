## Exception

Specialists, Leadership and Council Members have made a commitment to that role and as such are expected to maintain an increased level of activity that their role demands.

However, no one is _locked_ into a specific position and if their real-life commitments change in such a manner that they are no longer able to commit the necessary time and/or effort to the Task Force that their role demands - it is expected that they will gacefully step down and allow someone else to take over.

## Squadron Leadership

> There is a expectation that squadron leadership **shall** produce at least a single event per month. These events could include: training, 24/7 get together, public server takeover, etc...
>
> Although the expectation is a single event, it is **highly encouraged** that an even higher number of events are held.
>
> **Failure to do so, will result in removal from your leadership role.**
