    description: How the Task Force handles electing new council members.
---

Given the structure of the Task Force is modeled after a non-profit organization in that we have a Council of Directors who are responsible for providing direction for the Task Force it is only prudent to hold elections so that the general membership has a say in who fills those positions.

## Types of Elections

### General Election

Per our [charter](/docs/charter), once per year the Task Force holds a **General Election**. The purpose of the General Election is to elect new folks into the role of Director. Again - per the charter, 3 of the 7 members of the Council are directors who serve a one (1) year term and need to be elected into those roles by the membership as a whole.

### Special Election

A special election is held when a Director has either stepped down, or been removed from their seat prior to the end of their term. The process is the same - the only difference is when it occurs.

Special Elections are called in order to fill seats that are vacant so as to ensure the business of the Task Force does not faulter.

## Election Process

### Election Call

One month prior to the **Annual General Meeting** at the monthly Council Meeting, an election call will be made. After this has occurred - folks will be presented with the opportunity to put forth their name for nomination.

### Nominations

Each person who wishes to have their name put forth for nomination must first meet certain criteria:

- You must hold a **minimum** of **Grade 5**
- You must obtain four (4) vouches from other members. Two (2) of which may be from members of your specific squadron and the remaining two (2) must be from membership at large.

Once you have obtained the necessary vouches and are a minimum of Grade 5 - the Snr. Directors within the council will "qualify" you.

**What does that mean?**

Qualifiying a potential nominee is as simple as ensuring the basic requriements are met, and more importantly ensuring that the nominee is **actually** aware as to what the commitments they are signing up for are so that they are entering this venture with all the information.

### Voting

All voting is conducted through the membership portal.

Voting is **blind** meaning - only you will know who you have voted for.

### Results

A tally of the votes coming in will **not** be available until the actual election day. During the election day meeting, a tally of the votes will be displayed for all to see. Once the election has concluded, the results will be posted for all to digest and the newly minted Directors will be welcomed in.
