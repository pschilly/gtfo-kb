    description: All available custom liveries created for Task Force aircraft.
---

The Task Force is slowly compiling a repository of liveries for each of the airframes that we offer. Our liveries are created by memebers of the Task Force and are entirely unique. Some squadrons have chosen "stand in" liveries as their official livery to be used during flights until a custom one can be made. Take a look below for information on what liveries are to be used for each Squadron, and most importantly - where to download our custom ones!

## Custom Livery Pack

The Task Force custom liveries can be downloaded from the Github repository, here: [https://github.com/pschilly/gtfo-liveries/releases/latest](https://github.com/pschilly/gtfo-liveries/releases/latest)

The following squadrons have custom liveries included in the pack:

- 449th TFS - F-18C
- 191st FS - A-10C II
- 19th Helo - CH-47F
- 62nd FS - Mig-29A
- 482nd FS - F-15E
- 507th FS - F-16C

## Approved Liveries

The following squadrons have assigned specific liveries to be used while flying their airframes. If your squadron is not listed here, you may choose one at will - general rule of thumb is to keep it to one that is included in DCS so that everyone can see it:

### VF-141

VF-141 has opted to use a livery that is extremely close to what they are looking for in a final custom livery:

- F-14A-80-GR BuNO "VF-142 Ghostriders"

This livery can be downloaded from the DCS User Files located here: [https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/3327599/](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/3327599/).

### 479th FIS

479th has opted to use a livery that was included with the module for the time being:

- Euro One 68th Fighter Squadron

There are plans for a custom livery for this airframe, however, we are currently at the mercy of Heatblur to release a paint kit.
