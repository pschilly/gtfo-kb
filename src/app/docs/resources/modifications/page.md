## Required Modifications

These following mods are "required" for play on all Task Force servers.

### DCS Simple Radio Standalone

SRS is the primary method of communications during both organized and unorganized gameplay and is required by every member of the Task Force.

SRS can be downloaded at [http://dcssimpleradio.com/](http://dcssimpleradio.com/)

If you need assistance in setting SRS up, please view the following [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaHBJQm3R0Q).

### Community A-4E-C

The A-4 was a cold war workhorse, providing a capable, reliable light attack aircraft to dozens of nations around the world. Within the Task Force, it serves that exact same purpose.

### UH-60L Blackhawk

The DCS UH-60L Black Hawk mod is an incredibly detailed, free community aircraft featuring an extensive clickable cockpit and an Enhanced Flight Model (EFM). Recent updates introduced the heavily-armed DAP variant, Force Feedback support, and AI door gunners. It's an awesome, high-quality mod rivaling paid modules for transport and attack missions.

### 476 vFG - Air Weapons Range Objects
