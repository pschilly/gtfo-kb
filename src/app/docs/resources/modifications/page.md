## Required Modifications

These following mods are "required" for play on all Task Force servers.

### DCS Simple Radio Standalone

SRS is the primary method of communications during both organized and unorganized gameplay and is required by every member of the Task Force.

SRS can be downloaded at [http://dcssimpleradio.com/](http://dcssimpleradio.com/)

If you need assistance in setting SRS up, please view the following [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaHBJQm3R0Q).

### Community A-4E-C

The A-4 was a cold war workhorse, providing a capable, reliable light attack aircraft to dozens of nations around the world. Within the Task Force, it serves that exact same purpose.

### C-130J-30 Super Hercules

The C-130J is an extremely versatile aircraft for logistics - it is capable of carrying both troops / vehicles as well as munitions. In addition, it has a limited "CAS" role with the built in Battle Station which effectively turns it into a Specter Gunship - although limited in this capacity - it adds an interested layer to potential operations.

### 476 vFG - Air Weapons Range Objects

Some of the Task Force training missions may include this mod to create more realistic and immersive target ranges. These targets provide more feedback which is invaluable from a training perspective.
