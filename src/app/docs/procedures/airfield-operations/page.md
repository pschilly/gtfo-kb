    description: Standard Airfield Operation procedures that all must abide to ensure safe flight operations while over land.
---

Airfield Operations are crucial for the safe and efficient movement of all aircraft, including military aircraft, both on the ground and in the air within the airport's controlled airspace. For military aircraft, these operations are particularly vital due to their unique performance characteristics, mission requirements, and often specialized equipment.

| **Hold Short Line** {% airfieldmarker image="hold-short" className="w-auto h-1/8" /%}                  | Denotes where one should stop before entering a controlled runway or taxiway. The dashed line is always on the HOT side, meaning stop before the SOLID line.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Direction Marker** {% airfieldmarker image="direction-marker" className="w-auto h-1/8" /%}           | Denotes the direction of taxiway DELTA - most commonly found at exits off of a runway or at intersections in the airfield.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Distance Marker** {% airfieldmarker image="distance-marker" className="w-auto h-1/8" /%}             | Used to indicate how much runway is remaining. When looking at this sign - the "5" indicates there is 5000 feet of runway left before you reach the button, or end, of the runway. These will be found on the left and right thresholds of the runways                                                                                     |
| **Taxiway Marker** {% airfieldmarker image="taxi-marker" className="w-auto h-1/8" /%}                  | Incidates that you are currently on taxiway DELTA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Runway Marker** {% airfieldmarker image="runway-marker" className="w-auto h-1/8" /%}                 | Approaching a runway, 06-24. Further - when looking at this sign - the order of the num bers indicates what direction (left or right) is the end of the runway. So looking directly at this, the button of runway 06 will be to the left and 24 to the right. In addition - runway markings are done so in based on the compass direction. |
| **Runway with Taxiway Marker** {% airfieldmarker image="runway-with-taxi" className="w-auto h-1/8" /%} | Denotes you are approaching a runway, 06-24, and are currently on taxiway DELTA. Commonly found in conjunction with a hold-short line                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
